  "description": "\nThe Plasma workspace provides an application called KRunner which, among other\nthings, allows one to type into a text area which causes various actions and\ninformation that match the text appear as the text is being typed.\n\nOne application for this is the universal runner you can launch with ALT-F2.\n\nThis functionality is provided via plugins loaded at runtime called \"Runners\".\nThese plugins can be used by any application using the Plasma library. The\nKRunner framework is used to write these plugins.\n\n",
