**This directory contains a node.js program to update the manifests with topics from 
the file `topics.csv`.** 

Follow the instructions given below to run the program.

* Install node (better to use nvm to install node.js).
* Copy the library folders that contain the manifest files required to be updated 
and paste them at `manifests` directory and `update_manifests` directory.

* You will find the updated manifests at `update_manifests` directory.


**Note:**

directory.
