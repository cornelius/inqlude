  "description": "This library contains simple XML-RPC Client support. It is a complete\nclient and is quite easy to use. Only one interface is exposed to the\nworld, kxmlrpcclient/client.h and of that interface, you only need to\nuse 3 methods: setUrl, setUserAgent and call.\n\nA small note on authentication. If you will be accessing an XML-RPC server\nwhich uses HTTP-AUTH, simply set the user and pass in the URL. To use\nDigest authentication, call setDigestAuthEnabled(true).",
