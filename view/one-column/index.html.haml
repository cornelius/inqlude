%p
  The goal of Inqlude is to provide a comprehensive listing of all
  existing libraries for developers of Qt applications. If you are creating
  applications using the #{link_to "Qt toolkit", "http://qt-project.org"}, and
  are looking for libraries, components
  or modules to use, Inqlude is the place where you find all information and
  pointers to get started.
%p
  This is a young project, we are still collecting information, and are
  building up the web site and the tools around it. If you would like to get
  involved, read more about #{link_to "how to contribute", "contribute"}, or go
  to the mailing list
  = link_to "inqlude.kde.org", "https://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/inqlude"
  to directly talk to us. See you there.
