%h4 Contributing data about libraries

%hr

%p
  To get a complete overview about all available Qt based libraries, we need
  to collect data about these libraries. This includes descriptions,
  instructions how to use them, as well as links to sources or installable
  packages.
%p
  The meta data used by Inqlude is collected in a git repository at
  = link( "http://github.com/cornelius/inqlude-data" )
  or
  = link( "https://projects.kde.org/projects/websites/inqlude-data" ) + "."
  It contains a manifest file in JSON format for each library, which has the
  meta data in a structured machine-readable form. JSON is easy enough for
  humans to read and edit as well. See the
  = link_to "specification of the manifest format", "https://github.com/cornelius/inqlude/blob/master/manifest-format.md"
  for documentation about what to put into the manifest.
%p
  You can contribute meta data by providing patches to the inqlude-data
  repository. Use the github mechanisms or just send patches by email.
  Contributions are welcome.

%h4 Contributing to the Inqlude tools

%hr

%p
  The command line tool is developed in another git repository at
  = link( "http://github.com/cornelius/inqlude" )
  or
  = link( "https://projects.kde.org/projects/websites/inqlude" ) + "."
  It's still in a proof-of-concept state, so there is quite a bit work left.
  Have a look at the
  = link_to "list of open issues", "http://github.com/cornelius/inqlude/issues"
  or read the source and come up with your own ideas what to improve.
%p
  Especially welcome are contributions for adding support for native
  package systems on the variety of Linux distributions and other systems
  out there.

%h4 Mailing list

%hr

%p
  If you want to discuss any aspects of Inqlude, get in contact with us, have
  questions, or want to contribute in any other way, the best way is to use the
  mailing list #{link_to "inqlude@kde.org", "https://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/inqlude"}.
