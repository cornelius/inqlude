  How to get libraries

%hr

%p
  This page is about how to use Inqlude as a user, a developer using Qt
  based libraries in her projects.
%p
  First you can just use the web site. Find the information about libraries
  here, and get the libraries using the provided links. This works and is the
  recommended way for now, but there is an experimental, but more convenient
  way.
%p
  You can also use the command line client. This client makes it easy to get
  the libraries you need with just a few commands, without having to know
  URLs, or how libraries are packages.
%p
  First you need to get the command line client.
  It's a Qt 5 application. If your distribution doesn't have a package for
  inqlude-client, you can download its sources from
  = link_to( "download.kde.org", "http://download.kde.org/devel/helpers/")
  or using
  .code
    git clone git://anongit.kde.org/inqlude-client
%p
  There is a second command line client, written in Ruby. It can also
  download libraries, but it is mostly aimed at maintaining the inqlude data.
  It's available as a Ruby gem, so when you have rubygems installed you can simply do a
  .code
    sudo gem install inqlude
  (For instructions how to get rubygems, see
  = link_to( "rubygems.org", "http://rubygems.org" ) + ")."
%p
  Once you have the client, you can get help about the available commands
  with
  .code
    inqlude
  Get a list of available libraries with
  .code
    inqlude list -r

  Install a library with
  .code
    inqlude install &lt;library_name&gt;

  Get a list of installed libraries with
  .code
    inqlude list
%p
  The command line client uses your native package management system. In
  case there is no meta data available for your system, the client falls
  back to handling sources. Please consider helping to get your system
  supported by contributing meta data or implementing a backend for your
  system. See the
  = link_to "instructions how to contribute", "contribute"
  for more details.
